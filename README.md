# simultaneous-target-interception
**Simultaneous Target Interception** is the implementation of the research paper    , which proposes a distributed guidance law for the simultaneous interception of a stationary target. The proposed guidance
law establishes the necessary conditions on static graphs as well as on switching graph topologies which ensures simultaneous target interception, regardless of the initial conditions of the pursuers. The proposed guidance formulation is extremely lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time use even on low-cost, resource-constrained onboard computers and in the practical scenarios, where factors such as limited sensory ranges, device failures and the presence of obstacles can
adversely hinder the communication between the pursuers, which leads to switching graphs.

```
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  libeigen3-dev \
  ros-humble-octomap-ros \
  ros-humble-ompl
```

Then simply clone and compile our package (using ssh here):

## 2. Algorithms and Papers

<!-- The project contains a collection of robust and computationally efficient algorithms for quadrotor fast flight:
* Kinodynamic path searching
* B-spline-based trajectory optimization
* Topological path searching and path-guided optimization
* Perception-aware planning strategy (to appear)

These methods are detailed in our papers listed below.

All planning algorithms along with other key modules, such as mapping, sfc generation are implemented in __minco-trajectory-planner__:

- __mapping__: The online mapping algorithms. The map is built using 2D LiDAR data from the `/scan` topic along with odometry. It takes in raw scan data of 2-D Lidar  and lidar pose (odometry) pairs as input, do raycasting to update a probabilistic volumetric map, and build an occupancy grid map for the planning system. We maintain a local occupancy grid centered around the drone, where each cell stores the belief of being occupied.

</p>

- __sfc_generation__: This module consists of  a Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation pipeline that converts obstacle-rich space into convex polytopes, using seed voxel extraction, rectangle expansion, QuickHull Algorithms . A dedicated C++ CorridorBuilder module then assembles and merges these polytopes along the A-star generated path to form a continuous safe corridor for trajectory optimization.

  <!-- <img src="files/icra20_1.gif" width = "320" height = "180"/> -->
</p>

- __minco_planner__: It includes the core MINCO-based trajectory optimization modules, covering differential flatness, trajectory parameterization, and nonlinear optimization. The implementation integrates supporting components such as geometric utilities, root finding, convex decomposition (QuickHull), and optimization solvers (LBFGS, SDLP) to generate smooth, dynamically feasible, and collision-free trajectories within the safe corridors.

- __plan_manage__: High-level modules that schedule and call the mapping and planning algorithms. Interfaces for launching the whole system, as well as the configuration files are contained here.

- __system_node__: This is the main ROS node that integrates, schedules, and calls the mapping, corridor generation, and planning algorithms. It handles real-time replanning by regenerating trajectories when new obstacles are detected and manages the overall system execution.

The full pipeline is validated in simulation (Gazebo–ROS–ArduPilot SITL)

## 3. Use in Your Application

<!-- If you have successfully run the simulation and want to use __minco-trajectory-planner__ in your project,
please explore the files kino_replan.launch or topo_replan.launch.
Important parameters that may be changed in your usage are contained and documented.

Note that in our configuration, the size of depth image is 640x480. 
For higher map fusion efficiency we do downsampling (in kino_algorithm.xml, skip_pixel = 2).
If you use depth images with lower resolution (like 256x144), you might disable the downsampling by setting skip_pixel = 1. Also, the _depth_scaling_factor_ is set to 1000, which may need to be changed according to your device.

Finally, for setup problem, like compilation error caused by different versions of ROS/Eigen, please first refer to existing __issues__, __pull request__, and __Google__ before raising a new issue. Insignificant issue will receive no reply.
